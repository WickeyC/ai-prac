The default values of the attributes are zero (0), but the constructor of the class allows the hour, minute and second to be set by the user when an instance is created. Time has a method called tick(), which will increase the second by 1 each time it is executed. Therefore after 10,000 iterations of tick(), the “hour” attribute will increase by 2, the “minute” will increase by 46, and the “second” will increase by 40. Hence, printing the Time instance after 10,000 iterations of tick() will display 2:46:40 on the screen if all the attributes of hour, minute and second are not set.  On the other side, if the attributes are set as 13 hours, 20 minutes and 5 seconds when the instance is created, then printing the Time instance after 10,000 iterations of tick() will result in 16:6:45 displayed on the screen. 3"
